The model reproduces the time profiles of Calcium in the spine and dendrites
as depicted in Fig 8 and Fig 9 of the paper for CF activation.

The model was reproduced using MathSBML.

Please note that the units of volume species is molecules/micrometer cubed as
against the units of microMolar given in the paper. To convert the units to
microMolar multiply the species concentration by the conversion factor 1/602.
